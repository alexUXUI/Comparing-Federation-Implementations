## Introduction

<details>
<summary>Introduction</summary>

Module Federation (MF) and Native Federation (NF) offer two distinct approaches to code federation, each with strengths and weaknesses. The choice depends on application needs.

This document compares both approaches using the Federation Conceptual Framework, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses within a standardized model.

</details>

## Federation Conceptual Framework

<details>
<summary>Conceptual Framework</summary>

Federation consists of three layers: Resolution, Integration, and Management.

- **Layers** contain steps defining key processes.
- **Steps** are measured by properties that provide meaningful comparisons between implementations.
- **Properties** define key characteristics of each step and provide objective comparison criteria.

The following sections analyze each layer, breaking down steps and properties to compare Module Federation and Native Federation.

</details>

## 1) Resolution Layer

<details>
<summary>Resolution Layer</summary>

The Resolution Layer is the first step in federation, where code is resolved and loaded into the consumer's runtime. It consists of:

1.a) Runtime Initialization: Configuring the runtime environment
1.b) Code Resolution: Loading remote modules into the consumer runtime

### 1.a) Runtime Initialization

Measured by:

- **Configurability**: Runtime configuration options
- **Independence**: Support for independent runtimes

| Property        | Native Federation | Module Federation |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Configurability | ❌ No runtime share scope configuration | ✅ Supports runtime dependency configuration |
| Independence   | ❌ No independent runtime support | ✅ Supports independent runtimes |

#### Configurability

Module Federation [init](https://module-federation.io/guide/basic/runtime.html#init) allows runtime share scope configuration, supporting shared singletons and stateful services across multiple MFEs.

#### Independence

Native Federation relies on import maps, requiring all remotes to be defined in the host, introducing tight coupling. Module Federation supports independent runtimes, allowing services to load dynamically without host coordination.

**Example:** With Module Federation, products like Thread can manage service dependencies independently, such as Content Viewer, without host involvement.

### 1.b) Code Resolution

Native Federation uses browser-native Import Maps, while Module Federation employs a Container API that loads modules via a JSON manifest and Webpack's container runtime.

Measured by:

- **Initial Load Performance**: Network calls, render-blocking resources, LCP, CPU throttle

| Property                | Native Federation | Module Federation |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Initial Load Performance | ❌ | ✅ |
| Network Calls          | 19               | 11                |
| Render-Blocking Resources | 1 | 0 |
| LCP (Normal) | 110ms | 50ms |
| LCP (Fast 4G) | 1.48s | 0.62s |
| LCP (Slow 4G) | 5.03s | 2.14s |
| LCP (3G) | 17.70s | 6.14s |
| LCP (CPU Throttle 20x) | 0.89s | 0.49s |
| Runtime Init | 24.86ms | 18.73ms |

#### Initial Load Performance

Native Federation requires more network requests, impacting performance on poor connections. A render-blocking resource (`es-module-shims.js`) further slows app loading if bottlenecked.

### Resolution Layer Real-World Impact

- **Module Federation**: Lower bounce rates, better conversion, improved performance on low-end devices.
- **Native Federation**: Higher bounce rates, limited reach in emerging markets, best suited for robust infrastructure.

## 2) Integration Layer

<details>
<summary>Integration Layer</summary>

Handles how federated remotes integrate into the consumer runtime.

### 2.a) Dependency Resolution

Measured by:

- **Version Management**: Dependency version handling
- **Sharing Strategy**: Shared dependency handling

| Property | Native Federation | Module Federation |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Version Management | ✅ Import Maps | ✅ Semver ranges |
| Sharing Strategy | ✅ Build-time configuration | ✅ Flexible sharing strategies |

### 2.b) Module Integration

Measured by:

- **Initialization Control**: Control over module initialization
- **Scope Isolation**: Module boundary management
- **Error Handling**: Error recovery mechanisms

| Property | Native Federation | Module Federation |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Initialization Control | ❌ Standard ESM | ✅ Container API |
| Scope Isolation | ❌ Basic scoping | ✅ Enhanced isolation |
| Error Handling | ❌ Manual handling | ✅ Built-in handling |

### Integration Layer Real-World Impact

- **Module Federation**: Supports authentication, feature flagging, and global state management.
- **Native Federation**: Requires additional implementation for authentication and state synchronization.

</details>

## 3) Runtime Management Layer

<details>
<summary>Runtime Management Layer</summary>

Handles runtime execution management.

### 3.a) Runtime Control

| Property | Native Federation | Module Federation |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Module Loading | ❌ Limited control | ✅ Programmatic control |
| Lifecycle Management | ❌ Basic ESM lifecycle | ✅ Full lifecycle control |
| Module Graph Management | ✅ Basic support | ✅ Advanced control |

### 3.b) Runtime Extension

| Property | Native Federation | Module Federation |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Plugin Support | ❌ No plugin system | ✅ Extensible plugin system |
| Security Controls | ❌ Manual implementation | ✅ Plugin-based security framework |
| Error Handling | ❌ Manual | ✅ Built-in recovery |
| Monitoring Capabilities | ❌ Limited | ✅ Comprehensive |

### Runtime Management Layer Real-World Impact

- **Module Federation**: Enhanced security, error handling, and monitoring.
- **Native Federation**: Higher manual effort for security and error management.

## Options Comparison

<details>
<summary>Comparison Summary</summary>

Module Federation offers greater flexibility, while Native Federation prioritizes simplicity.

| Federation Layer | Native Federation | Module Federation |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Resolution | More network calls, render-blocking resources, slower LCP | Fewer network calls, no render-blocking resources, better LCP |
| Integration | Exact version matching, basic scoping, manual error handling | Semver range support, enhanced isolation, built-in error handling |
| Management | Limited runtime control, no plugins, basic monitoring | Programmatic control, extensible plugin system, comprehensive monitoring |

</details>

## Conclusion

<details>
<summary>Conclusion</summary>

| Layer | Module Federation | Native Federation |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Resolution | Faster initial page loads, independent runtime support, better performance on slow networks | Higher bounce rates, limited scalability, additional coordination overhead |
| Integration | Team autonomy, better dependency management, optimized performance | Simple onboarding, higher storage and bandwidth costs |
| Management | Customization, scalability, monitoring, and error recovery | Suitable for smaller teams, potential refactoring needs |

This comparison highlights that Module Federation offers greater flexibility at the cost of complexity, while Native Federation provides simplicity with some trade-offs. The choice should be based on project complexity, team expertise, and performance needs.
